                    <p class="about-paragraph">I'm Suvanjan Prasai, a student at the Global School of Science in
                        Kathmandu, and I'm passionate about programming and creating cool, innovative projects. Some of
                        the fun things I've worked on include an airline system with React and Python, a simple proxy
                        server, an HTTP server, and a student attendance tracker.
                        <br><br>
                        But the project I'm most proud of is JASMINE, a virtual assistant with a sleek GUI that gives
                        off serious JARVIS vibes (yes, the one from Iron Man!). Designing its user interface and
                        connecting it to the core functionalities was a tedious yet incredibly rewarding experience.

                        features. This includes booking section, status
                        section, contact section & admin section. My main motive behind building this is to learn react.
                        I had no idea about react before this project, now i have some idea and concept of it. The front end of this project is made up of react where as backend is made up of python's framework; flask.</p>

                        of this project it its GUI. I had to make multiple threads for main program and GUI, then i had
                        to make the functions communicate with functions of other thread, which was a tideous
